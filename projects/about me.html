            Hello there! <br><br>
            
            I'm <strong>SUBHASRILEKHA KASIVISWANATHAN</strong>,<br><br>

            A passionate and hardworking individual with a strong interest in web development and data science. <br>
            
            I have an insatiable appetite for learning, and I'm eager to delve deeper into the realms of web development
            and artificial intelligence. <br>

            My journey in the world of technology has been a thrilling one, and I find joy in crafting elegant solutions 
            and bringing creative ideas to life.<br>

            Apart from my technical pursuits, I have a fascination for understanding the 
            intricacies of human psychology and enjoy interacting with people on a deeper level.<br> 
            I firmly believe that emotional intelligence is an essential aspect of personal growth and professional success.
            In pursuit of this, I have completed an emotional intelligence certificate through LinkedIn Learning.<br>
            
            As a web developer, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to create immersive and user-friendly experiences
             on the web. <br>
             I love experimenting with cutting-edge technologies and frameworks to stay at the forefront of this rapidly
              evolving field. <br>
        On the other hand, my curiosity for data science allows me to derive meaningful insights from data, uncover 
        patterns, and make data-driven decisions.
        
        I believe in continuous improvement, and I'm always open to collaborate and learn from others.<strong>
